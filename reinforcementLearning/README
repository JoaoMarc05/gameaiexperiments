Assuming that you have all the dependencies installed (Tensorflow, keras etc)
then run the application using:

ipython reinforcementLearningNeuralNetworkDodge.py


This will train a neural network to play Dodge (the block at the bottom of the
play area has to avoid the blocks falling from the top of the play area). This
will take about a minute if running tensorflow on the CPU.
It will then demonstrate the trained model's prowess.
